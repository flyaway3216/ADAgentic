# Contributing to ADAgentic.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to a ADAgentic! I welcome contributions that align with  mission of creating secure, capable software to help AI coding agents.

## üéØ Our Direction

Before contributing, please review the [README](README.md) and [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to understand the project's goals. I'm happy to accept contributions that:

- **Align with our current direction** as outlined in our documentation
- **Propose changes to our direction** - but please discuss these in advance so we can understand the reasoning and ensure it fits our vision

## üîí Security First

Since this project focuses on secure AI agent frameworks, security considerations are paramount in all contributions.

### Security Review Process
- All code changes are reviewed for security implications
- Security-sensitive contributions require additional scrutiny
- For security vulnerabilities, please use our private reporting process (see Security section below)
- Contributors should describe the security impact of their changes

### Private Security Reporting
If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead:
- Email me at QuantumFrogPro@proton.me 
- Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
- We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and work with you on disclosure

## üìã Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

### Bug Fixes
- Security bugs (use private reporting)
- Regular functionality bugs
- Include reproduction steps and test cases

### New Features
- Agent capabilities and improvements
- Framework core enhancements
- Tool integrations
- Always discuss larger features before implementation

### Security Improvements
- Hardening existing code
- Security audits and reviews
- Vulnerability fixes

### Documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Security best practices
- API documentation
- Code comments and explanations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Standards

*Note: This project is in early stages, so these are our initial guidelines. We're open to refining these processes as the project grows.*

### Code Quality
- **Code style**: We'll implement automated formatting (details TBD)
- **Testing**: Include unit tests for new features, especially security-related functionality
- **Documentation**: Document your code, especially security considerations
- **Dependencies**: New dependencies require discussion and approval due to supply chain security concerns

### Review Process
- All changes must go through pull request review
- No direct commits to main branch (including maintainers)
- 1-2 approvals required depending on change size and risk level
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review

## üí¨ Discussion and Planning

### Where to Discuss
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, and smaller discussions
- **GitHub Discussions**: Design discussions, questions, and broader topics
- **Pull Requests**: Code-specific discussions and reviews

### Before You Start
For larger contributions:
1. Open an issue or discussion to propose your idea
2. Wait for feedback before starting significant work
3. This helps ensure your contribution will be accepted and aligns with our goals

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes following our technical standards
4. Write or update tests as needed
5. Update documentation if necessary
6. Open a pull request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Security impact assessment
   - Reference to related issues

## üìù Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Clear, concise description of the change
- **Description**: Include:
  - What problem this solves
  - How you've tested the changes
  - Any security considerations
  - Breaking changes (if any)
- **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized for easier review

## üèõÔ∏è Governance

- Project maintainers have final say on contributions
- We're open to adding trusted contributors as maintainers as the project grows
- Major direction changes require discussion and consensus
- We aim to respond to contributions within 1 - week

## ‚ùì Questions?

- Check existing issues and discussions first
- Open a new discussion for general questions
- For urgent matters, contact QuantumFrogPro@proton.me
